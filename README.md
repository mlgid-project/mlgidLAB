A desktop GUI for the
[mlgidBASE](https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidBASE) GIWAXS analysis
pipeline. It drives the full
`pygid → mlgidDETECT → pygidFIT → mlgidMATCH` workflow in one PySide6
window: convert raw detector images to NeXus, then **detect / fit /
match**, **review and edit** peaks, and **export** — same algorithms,
visual control.

> **Alpha (`v0.1.0a17`).** The detect → fit → match → edit loop works end-to-end; expect
> rough edges and report issues. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for
> highlights.

A short walkthrough: raw detector image to reciprocal space, then the ML analysis
pipeline (detect, fit, match).

<sub>Recorded against `v0.1.0a17`. The same reel is attached to every release as
[`mlgidlab_demo_combined_1080p.mp4`](https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidLAB/releases/latest/download/mlgidlab_demo_combined_1080p.mp4)
if you would rather download it.</sub>

## Install & launch

Requires **Python ≥ 3.11** (Linux / macOS / Windows). A fresh conda
environment is recommended — the `[pipeline]` extra pulls a large ML
stack (PyTorch + the in-house mlgid packages), so keep it isolated.

```bash
# create + activate an isolated environment
conda create -n mlgidlab python=3.12 -y
conda activate mlgidlab

# full pipeline (detection / fitting / matching + raw conversion)
pip install "mlgidlab[pipeline] @ git+https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidLAB@v0.1.0a17"
mlgidlab
```

No conda? Any Python ≥ 3.11 virtual environment works
(`python -m venv mlgidlab && source mlgidlab/bin/activate`).

Drop `[pipeline]` for view-only mode (browse + edit existing NeXus
results, in-GUI pyFAI calibration; Run buttons disabled). Full per-OS
install, a first-file walkthrough, and shortcuts are in
**[docs/getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md)**.

## What you can do

- **Open** NeXus or raw HDF5 by auto-detection; multiple files at once.
- **View** in Cartesian (q_xy / q_z) or polar; frame playback, colormap,
  log/linear contrast, live cursor readout; multi-GB stacks load lazily.
- **Convert** raw → NeXus (batch), with an embedded pyFAI calibration
  dialog for PONI + mask.
- **Detect / fit / match** from the Pipeline dock (every mlgidBASE
  parameter exposed), at frame / entry / all-entries scope.
- **Edit peaks**: manual boxes, Add-to-fitted (2D pygidfit or 1D);
  multi-select detected *or* fitted (`Ctrl+click`, `Ctrl+A`), on the
  image or in the tables; copy/paste detected (`Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V`,
  `Ctrl+Shift+V` for a frame range); batch 2D fit; bulk delete; full
  undo/redo (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`).
- **Label fast**: *Quick select* commits each hand-drawn box as you
  draw the next one, as a detected peak, a fitted one, or both. Each
  fit is stored under its detected peak's id, so a peak has one fit and
  deleting the detection takes the fit with it (both switchable in
  Settings).
- **Inspect**: sortable Detected / Fitted / Matched tables with
  click-sync to the image; live radial + angular profile fits; overlay
  filters; a workflow rail above the image showing what each pipeline
  stage has produced for the current frame.
- **Export** figures (matplotlib) and peaks as CSV.

- **[Getting started](docs/getting_started.md)** — install, first run,
  shortcuts, troubleshooting.
- **[Backend compatibility](docs/backend_compatibility.md)** — pipeline
  version policy + how to verify a backend bump.
- **[Manual test plan](docs/manual_test_plan.html)** — click-through
  checklist for alpha testers. Download it and open in a browser; grab
  the `example.zip` dataset — hosted once on the
  [v0.1.0a9 release](https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidLAB/releases/download/v0.1.0a9/example.zip)
  and reused for every version, so later releases carry no attachments.
