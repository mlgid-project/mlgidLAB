"""An empty simulated CIF pattern must read as a data problem.

pygidsim <= 0.1.4 ended ``GIWAXS.giwaxs_2d`` with a named
``ValueError("There are no peaks in the pattern.")``. Since 0.1.7 it
returns empty arrays, so the failure lands one frame later inside
mlgidmatch (``intensity / intensity.max()`` on a zero-size array) and
numpy's message mentions neither CIFs nor q ranges.
``pipeline._build_cif_pattern_from_raw`` re-raises it as a
``RuntimeError`` that names the input and the usual cause.

The wrap is narrow on purpose: only the two empty-pattern wordings are
relabelled (pygidsim's own and the numpy one it became). Any other
``ValueError`` - a malformed CIF out of xrayutilities, an unknown
element - already names its own cause and goes up untouched.

Driven with a stub ``CifPattern`` injected into ``sys.modules``, so
these run on a backend-free CI box as well as against the real stack.
