"""Linux desktop integration, so the shell can find the app's icon.

``setWindowIcon`` fills the window's own icon and, on X11, ``_NET_WM_ICON``.
It does not reach the dash, the window switcher or the top bar: GNOME
resolves a window to an *application* first and takes the icon from that
application's ``.desktop`` file. mlgidLAB shipped no such file, so there
was nothing to resolve to.

The fix is two names that have to agree -- ``setDesktopFileName`` (the
Wayland ``app_id`` / X11 ``WM_CLASS`` instance) and a ``.desktop`` file of
that basename -- so most of what is worth testing here is agreement, plus
the property that a broken ``$HOME`` cannot take the startup down with it.
