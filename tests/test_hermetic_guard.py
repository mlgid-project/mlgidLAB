"""Locks in the backend-free claim for the pure-logic path.

Importing ``file_model`` / ``fit`` must not drag in the heavy analysis
stack — those are imported lazily only by ``pipeline.py`` when a
pipeline command actually runs (and by ``manual_fit.py`` when the
"Add to fitted" path's 2D fit is invoked).

The assertion is order-independent: it snapshots ``sys.modules``
before the imports and confirms the two specific imports add no
heavy backend modules. This survives running the test suite in any
order (earlier tests may have already loaded pygid via
``test_manual_fit.py`` or ``test_energy_guard.py``).
