"""Detection-model cache pre-flight.

Guards the release bug where a GUI-only install could never obtain the
mlgidDETECT weights. Three distinct failures had to line up, and each
gets a test here:

1. A GUI launched through the ``gui-scripts`` entry point runs under
   ``pythonw.exe`` on Windows, where ``sys.stdout is None``.
   mlgidDETECT's downloader renders a progress bar with a bare
   ``sys.stdout.write``, so the download died on its first tick with
   ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'``.
2. That aborted download left a zero-byte ``.onnx`` in the cache, and
   mlgidDETECT's ``check_filepath`` only tests existence plus the file
   extension — so the corpse was accepted forever after and no
   re-download was ever attempted.
3. Every one of those failures surfaced as the same opaque "Detection
   failed. Couldn't load the model.", because ``Inference.__init__``
   calls ``sys.exit()`` and mlgidbase catches it in a bare ``except:``.

No network: the HTTP layer is monkeypatched throughout.
