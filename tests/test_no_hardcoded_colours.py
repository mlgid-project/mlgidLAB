"""No module may bake a colour literal into a stylesheet.

A hardcoded hex is a colour that was chosen for one theme, so it stays
wrong in the other: this is exactly how the app ended up painting a
``#19232d`` preview pane inside a light window and ``#444`` separators
across the status bar. Colours belong in ``theme_tokens``, applied either
through the skin (a ``[status=…]`` / ``[role=…]`` tag) or, where the
value is genuinely data, through an f-string that reads a token.

The scan is AST-based rather than textual so it sees only real
``setStyleSheet`` arguments — comments and docstrings that mention a hex
(there are several, explaining history) do not trip it.
