"""One browsing directory shared by every file dialog in the app.

Alpha testers hit this constantly: opening a scan, then picking a
mask, then saving a PONI walked through three unrelated starting
directories. Each call site passed its own ``dir`` argument, and the
most common one was a bare suggested filename -- which Qt resolves
against the *process working directory*, i.e. ``/`` under a desktop
launcher.

Every picker in mlgidLAB now goes through this module, and the rule
is one sentence: **a dialog opens in the directory the user last
browsed, and a caller may only suggest a file name.** Suggested
paths are reduced to their basename on purpose (see ``start_at``) --
honouring one caller's absolute path is exactly how the starting
directory used to jump around. The directory is written back to
``QSettings`` on every accept, so it survives a restart as well as
the session.

Two things live outside this module and are wired to it:

- pyFAI's calibration window builds its own dialogs (the "Save as
  PONI" button among them), so they are adopted through
  ``CalibrationContext.createFileDialog`` -- see
  ``calibration_dialog._patch_pyfai_dialogs``, which calls ``adopt``.
- The File-browser dock's own Open path is ``_pick_files``, which
  uses ``open_files`` here.

All dialogs are non-native, which used to be true of the Open dialog
only. The reason generalised with this change: every picker now
starts in whatever directory the user last worked in, which on a
beamtime machine is routinely a folder of thousands of detector
images, and the platform-native picker thumbnails every one of them
before the listing becomes scrollable. ``_FastFileIconProvider``
keeps it constant-time.
