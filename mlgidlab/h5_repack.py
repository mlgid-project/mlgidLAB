"""Reclaiming the space a deleted HDF5 object leaves behind.

``del group[name]`` unlinks an object; it does not shrink the file.
HDF5 marks the blocks free for *reuse within that file* and the file
keeps every byte it had, so a user who deletes a 2 GB stack and saves
sees a file exactly as large as before. There is no API that shrinks a
file in place -- the only way to get the space back is to write the
surviving objects into a new file, which is what ``h5repack`` does and
what :func:`repack` does here without requiring the HDF5 tools to be
installed.

Repacking is a whole-file rewrite, so it is not free and must not run on
every save. :func:`should_repack` decides, from two numbers:

* the file's size on disk, and
* its *live* bytes -- the sum of ``get_storage_size()`` over every
  dataset, i.e. what the data actually occupies.

The difference is slack: metadata, B-tree nodes, and the holes left by
deletions. Measured on real files, that discriminates cleanly.

    a healthy 307 MB converted scan   0.7 % slack
    the same file, freshly repacked   2.2 % slack
    a file with half its data deleted 50.8 % slack

So a ratio threshold separates "normal overhead" from "something was
deleted" without having to track deletions, which would miss anything
done outside the editor's own undo history. The walk that produces the
live figure costs 0.16 s over the 2518 objects of that 307 MB file,
against a save that already copies the whole file -- cheap enough to run
on every save.

A floor accompanies the ratio because overhead is a large *fraction* of
a small file: a 40 KB NeXus skeleton is mostly metadata and would repack
forever on a threshold expressed only as a percentage, while saving
nothing worth the rewrite.

``h5py``'s ``get_freespace()`` is deliberately not used. Under the
default file-space strategy it reported 0 on a file with half its
datasets deleted, because the freed blocks went to the aggregator rather
than to a tracked free-space manager.
