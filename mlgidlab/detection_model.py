"""Detection-model cache pre-flight for the GUI.

mlgidDETECT ships no ``.onnx`` weights: the first detection run
downloads them into a per-user cache (``appdirs.user_data_dir(
'mlgiddetect')``) via ``mlgiddetect.utils.path_utils``. Two properties
of that downloader make it unsafe to drive from a GUI process, and this
module exists to work around both without touching the backend.

1. ``path_utils.download`` renders a progress bar with
   ``sys.stdout.write``. A GUI launched through the ``gui-scripts``
   entry point runs under ``pythonw.exe`` on Windows, where
   ``sys.stdout`` is ``None`` — so the very first progress tick raises
   ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'``. The
   downloader swallows it in a bare ``except``, returns ``None``, and
   ``Inference.__init__`` then calls ``sys.exit()``. mlgidbase's
   ``load_inference`` catches even that (bare ``except:`` sees
   ``SystemExit``) and re-raises the generic "Detection failed.
   Couldn't load the model." The user never learns a download was
   attempted. ``safe_console`` closes this hole.

2. ``urllib.request.urlretrieve`` writes straight to the *final* path,
   so any interruption leaves a truncated — often zero-byte — file
   behind. ``path_utils.check_filepath`` only tests that the path
   exists and ends in ``.onnx``, so that corpse is accepted forever
   after: no re-download is attempted and onnxruntime fails with an
   opaque ``[ONNXRuntimeError] ... Load model ... failed``. The install
   is then permanently broken even once (1) is fixed.
   ``ensure_detection_model`` downloads through a unique temp file and
   only ``os.replace``s it into place after the byte count matches
   ``Content-Length``, and it deletes previously poisoned cache entries
   so existing broken installs self-heal.

Everything here degrades to a no-op when mlgiddetect is absent (the
headless CI suite does not ship the backend), and never raises for a
merely *unverifiable* cache — an offline user with a good model file
must keep working.

No Qt imports — keep this module independently testable.
