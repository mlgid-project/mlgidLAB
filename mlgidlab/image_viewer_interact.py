        updates the cached ``_frame_peaks`` PeakTable so the colored
        overlay tracks the drag live; recomputes the row's Cartesian
        ``q_xy`` / ``q_z`` from the new polar coordinates; re-renders
        and re-syncs the image-space ROI. Disk persistence happens
        separately on drag-end via the host's
        ``_on_peak_row_write_requested`` slot.
