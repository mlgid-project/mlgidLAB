"""Wiring for the Structure tab: file-browser selection in, panel out.

Plain mixin over ``MainWindow`` — no ``__init__``, no Signals; all state
lives on the combined class, like every other ``main_window_*`` mixin.

Two rules shape this file.

**The dock stays the navigator.** The Structure tab has no tree of its
own; it renders whatever the File-browser dock has selected. That is why
the wiring hangs off ``_on_tree_selection_changed`` and why a click is
*deferred* while the tab is hidden, exactly as the Data tab's node is
(``_set_or_defer_data_node``): a single click on the Image tab must not
pay for work the user cannot see.

**Reads go through one accessor.** ``_structure_read`` yields the
already-open edit handle when there is one and a short-lived ``r`` open
otherwise, so no code path here has to know which of the two is in play.
A read-only open alongside silx's own read handles is safe; the
write-handle rules live in ``mlgidlab.h5_edit``.
