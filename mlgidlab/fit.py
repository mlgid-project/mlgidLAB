"""1D Gaussian fitting helpers for the radial / angular profile overlays.

This module's output paints the live preview curves on the profile
viewer for the active manual / detected box. It is not pygidFIT:

  * ``fit.py``        — fast 1D scipy fit, profile overlay
  * ``manual_fit.py`` — slow 2D pygidfit fit, the default persisted
                        truth (physics-audit finding F-06)

The default "2D fit (pygidfit)" mode never writes anything from here.
The legacy "1D fit (scipy)" mode of Add-to-fitted does persist these
values (centre + FWHM, with the 2D shape coefficients zero-filled),
which is why the fit below has to be defensible and not merely
plausible-looking on a plot.

Pure scipy/numpy — no Qt. Returns the fit curve sampled on a fine grid plus
the fitted parameters; callers decide where to draw it.

    persisted 2D Gaussian onto the radial / angular axis. The
    projection of an axis-aligned 2D Gaussian along one axis is just
    the 1D Gaussian with the same centre + FWHM in that direction, so
    we sample ``amplitude * exp(-(x-center)^2 / (2*sigma^2))`` over

    ``fit_range=(lo, hi)`` names the **peak region** — normally the
    user's box. It is not the fit window: the window is that region
    padded by ``BG_WINDOW_FACTOR`` of its width on each side, and the
    background line is estimated from the padding only, where there is
    actually baseline to see. Without ``fit_range`` the window is the
    legacy ``(0.5 + window_factor) × width_init`` half-width around
    ``center_init`` and the peak region is the middle ``width_init``
    of it.

    Two problems this shape exists to avoid, both reported from real
    use:

    * **Fits that refused peaks they should have taken.** Fitting only
      inside the box meant a box narrower than about six samples of the
      profile axis had no fit at all — on the default 1024-sample
      radial grid over a 3 × 3 Å⁻¹ q range that is any box under
      ~0.025 Å⁻¹. The window is four times the box, so the sample count
      is no longer the binding constraint.
    * **Nonsensical backgrounds.** Five free parameters (amplitude,
      centre, sigma, slope, intercept) inside a window that is all
      peak leaves the line unidentifiable, and it was seeded from
      points on the peak's own flanks. Measured on a clean synthetic
      peak, a six-sample box returned slope +393 / intercept −489
      against a true −5 / +50, and lost half the amplitude with it.
      Here the background is pinned by the flanks first and held
      fixed, leaving three free parameters for the peak.

    The peak itself is fitted on the peak region alone, with the
    background held at what the flanks said and the centre bounded to
    that region. Fitting it across the whole window instead would let a
    bright neighbour in the padding inflate the amplitude — measured at
    +82% on a synthetic neighbour four times the target's height. The
    padding informs the background and nothing else.

    A peak region holding fewer than ``MIN_PEAK_SAMPLES`` grows to the
    nearest that many samples of the window rather than returning
    nothing.

    ``render_range=(lo, hi)`` samples the returned curve over a
    different range than the fit used. It is clipped to the fit window:
    the background is a line, and extrapolating it past the data that
    constrained it is how the overlay used to shoot off the plot.
