"""The Structure tab: what the file browser's selection is, and editing it.

The third central tab, beside Image and Data. The File-browser dock
stays the one place a file is navigated; this panel answers the
questions the tree cannot show in a row — the full path, the type and
shape, every attribute, what a link points at, whether the pipeline
depends on this node, and what is wrong with the file as a whole — and
is where those things are changed.

The panel performs no I/O. It renders what ``MainWindow``'s
``StructureMixin`` hands it and emits an intent when the user asks for a
change; the mixin owns the file handle, does the write, and re-renders.
The panel therefore holds no authoritative state, and a failed edit
needs no rollback logic here — the re-render reconciles the display with
whatever the file actually says.
