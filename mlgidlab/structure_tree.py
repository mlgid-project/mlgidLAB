"""The Structure tab's own file tree.

The tab used to borrow the File-browser dock as its navigator. That put
navigation on one side of the window and editing in the middle, and it
meant the tab could not be used with the dock folded away. This is the
tab's own tree, so the editor is one self-contained surface.

**It holds nothing.** Every row stores two strings — the file it belongs
to and the path inside it — and no h5py object, no group, no file
handle. That is not tidiness, it is the constraint the whole feature
rests on: HDF5 refuses to open a file ``r+`` while any read handle on it
is open, so a tree that kept handles the way silx's does would have to
be torn down and rebuilt every time the editor took its write handle.
This one is never in the way, and it can refresh a single node's
children in place instead of being rebuilt whole.

Reading is therefore somebody else's job. ``set_lister`` installs a
callable — ``MainWindow``'s, which goes through the already-open write
handle when there is one — and the tree calls it when a row is expanded.
A callable rather than a signal because ``select_path`` has to walk
several levels down synchronously to reveal a search hit.

Links are listed, never followed. An external link gets a chevron and is
resolved only if the user expands it themselves, which is the same
bargain the Link card's Follow button makes.
