"""Extra per-frame peak tables, registered by the user as display layers.

A file's ``analysis/frameNNNNN/`` group can hold peak tables mlgidLAB
knows nothing about -- ``Br_peaks``, a second detector's picks, a
reference set from another tool. This module is the registry that turns
one of those into a layer: a dataset name, the label to show for it, and
whether it should look and read like a detected or a fitted layer.

**The ``list:`` prefix is the whole no-spill mechanism.** A registered
layer's kind is ``"list:Br_peaks"``, which can never equal
``"detected"``, ``"fitted"``, ``"manual"`` or ``"matched"`` -- and every
consumer in the app names its kinds explicitly (``tables.get("fitted")``,
``kind in ("manual", "detected")``). So the Peaks table, CSV export,
fitting, matching, tracking and the simulation overlay all ignore a
registered layer without a line of code, and the ways it CAN be reached
are the handful that were widened on purpose.

Pure and Qt-light on purpose (QSettings only, no h5py, no viewer): the
same shape as ``ai_values`` and ``frame_range``, so it stays testable
without a window.
