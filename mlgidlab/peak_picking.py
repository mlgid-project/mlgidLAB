"""Which overlay box did the user click?

Overlay boxes overlap constantly: a fitted box sits on top of the
detected box it refines, a wide detection contains a narrow one, and a
ring contains *every* spot peak at its radius, because mlgidLAB's ring
convention is ``angle = 45, angle_width = inf``. The old rule resolved
those by table order (highest row index wins), which is invisible to
the user: each overlay kind is drawn as a single ``QPainterPath`` with
one pen, so there is no "box on top" on screen to appeal to.

The rules here are the visible ones:

* **Kind first.** manual, then fitted, then detected, then matched, the
  order the app has always used. A refined fit still wins over the
  detection under it.
* **Then the smallest box.** Inside one kind the innermost box wins,
  because it is the one with nowhere else to be clicked; the box around
  it is still reachable everywhere the inner one is not.
* **Rings only on their edges.** A ring's box spans the whole angular
  range, so counting its interior would let it swallow every peak in
  its radius band. It is picked by clicking within a few screen pixels
  of the inner or outer radius instead.

Ties keep the caller's order, so feeding rows in reverse table order
preserves the old "highest row index wins" behaviour for boxes that are
genuinely the same size.

Pure functions over plain floats: no Qt, no PeakTable, so the rules can
be tested without building a viewer.
