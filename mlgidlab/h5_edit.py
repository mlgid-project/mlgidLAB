"""HDF5 editing primitives behind the Structure tab.

No Qt, no mlgidBASE — h5py and numpy only, so every operation here is
testable on its own and the module stays inside the backend-free
contract ``tests/test_hermetic_guard.py`` pins.

Three things in here are load-bearing and worth reading before touching
this file.

**The long-lived write handle.** ``EditHandle`` keeps one ``r+`` handle
open on the session's temp working copy for as long as the user is
editing. That is deliberate and it is safe only because of four HDF5
behaviours, each pinned by ``tests/test_h5_edit.py`` so an h5py or HDF5
upgrade that breaks one fails loudly:

1. opening ``r+`` while an ``r`` handle is open on the same file fails;
2. opening ``r`` while an ``r+`` handle is open succeeds, and the two
   share one underlying file object;
3. the ``r`` handle sees writes made through ``r+`` immediately,
   including groups created after it was opened;
4. a second ``r+`` open succeeds, and closing it leaves the first valid.

(2) and (3) are what let silx's read-only browser stay attached and
correct while the editor writes. (1) is why the handle may only be
acquired inside a detached window. (4) is why the peak-writing paths,
which open ``r+`` of their own, cannot be broken by an open editor
handle. Every commit calls ``flush()``, so ``File > Save``'s plain
``shutil.copy2`` of the temp copy is always consistent.

**Links are never followed by accident.** Anything that walks the file
(``walk_search``, ``node_nbytes``, ``validate``) inspects links with
``get(..., getlink=True)`` and descends only into hard links. A master
file whose 226 entries are external links to multi-GB scans can
therefore be searched and validated without opening a single one.
``node_info`` follows soft links (in-file, cheap) but reports an
external link rather than resolving it, unless asked with
``follow=True``.

**Protection is advisory.** ``protection_reason`` names the nodes the
viewer and the pipeline read. Nothing here refuses to act on them; the
GUI uses the reason string to warn before a destructive edit, which is
the behaviour the user asked for.
