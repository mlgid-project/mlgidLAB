"""Theme-aware SVG icons.

The shipped glyphs (``mlgidlab/assets/icons/*.svg``) are monochrome and
authored with ``stroke="currentColor"``. Qt's SVG renderer does not
resolve ``currentColor`` against the widget palette, so this module does
the substitution itself: it reads the SVG text, swaps in a hex from
``theme_tokens``, and rasterises the result at several sizes into one
``QIcon``. One source asset therefore stays crisp at every size and
adapts to both themes.

Two things a naive loader gets wrong, and how this one handles them:

* **Stale icons after a theme flip.** ``QIcon`` is a value type — clearing
  a cache does nothing for icons already handed to widgets. ``bind()``
  records the widget (weakly) against its glyph name and ``retheme()``
  re-applies them, so a theme switch walks ~50 registered targets rather
  than every widget in the app.
* **A broken install taking the window with it.** Every lookup failure
  returns a null ``QIcon``; a missing asset costs an icon, never a
  traceback. ``QToolButton`` renders text-only with a null icon, which is
  exactly what these buttons did before they had icons at all.
