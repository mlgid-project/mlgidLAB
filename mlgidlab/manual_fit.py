"""Single-peak 2D fit wrapper around ``pygidfit.fit_data``.

The GUI's "Add to fitted" action used to commit a 1D-Gaussian-derived
row to ``fitted_peaks`` with the 2D shape coefficients (A, B, C,
theta) zero-filled — physics-audit finding F-06's concrete failure
mode (the persisted manual fit was already partly fictitious).

This module replaces that path. ``fit_one_peak`` accepts a single
user-drawn box plus the active **cartesian** frame + q axes +
experimental geometry, replicates pygidfit's pipeline polar
conversion internally (``_get_polar_grid`` + ``polar_conversion``
+ ``img_preprocessing``), and runs ``pygidfit.fit_data`` on a
length-1 input. Using pygidfit's own conversion is what makes the
manual fit byte-identical to what the pipeline ``run_fitting``
writes for the same detected box — an earlier revision passed
mlgidlab's polar image (different resolution + scipy interpolation +
no ``img_preprocessing``) and produced visible drift between the
two paths.

The call also carries the frame's *neighbouring* peak boxes
(``select_neighbour_boxes``). pygidfit masks or joint-fits only the
boxes handed to one ``fit_data`` call, so a single-box call left a
neighbouring peak's intensity unmasked inside the target's ROI —
which, combined with pygidfit bounding the centre a quarter box
outside each edge, is how a manual fit could land outside the box
the user drew.

On any pygidfit failure (raises, returns empty, NaN amplitude) we
raise ``ManualFitError`` so callers can fall back to the legacy
1D + zero-fill behaviour or surface a clear error to the user.

    resample with ``polar_conversion`` (cv2 linear interp), then
