"""The fitted ↔ detected peak link: one fit per detection, same id.

``detected_peaks`` and ``fitted_peaks`` are two independent tables that
each assign their own ``max(id) + 1``, and nothing on disk records which
fit came from which detection. This module holds the two user settings
that change that, plus the one sentence of policy each one carries.

**Link** (``PEAK_LINK_KEY``, default on)
    A fit made from detected peak 42 is written as fitted peak 42.
    Fitting that detection again — with different borders, a different
    mode, whatever — replaces fitted 42 instead of appending a second
    row, so a detection can never accumulate fits. Deleting detected 42
    deletes fitted 42 with it. A pipeline fitting run numbers fitted
    rows positionally, so the run is followed by
    ``file_model.rekey_fitted_ids_to_detected`` to restore the pairing.
    A hand-drawn box is written to ``detected_peaks`` first and the fit
    pairs to that new row, so every fitted peak has a detected partner.

**Reverse delete** (``PEAK_LINK_REVERSE_KEY``, default off)
    Deleting a fitted peak also deletes its detected partner. Off by
    default because discarding a fit is the normal way to say "this
    prediction is wrong", which is not the same as saying the detection
    was wrong.

Both are read lazily wherever the behaviour is consumed — the same
shape as ``autoUpdate`` — so a change takes effect on the next action
without any wiring. With the link off every path behaves exactly as it
did before the setting existed; that is the acceptance criterion, and
the tests assert the off case alongside each on case.

Matched peaks are untouched by all of this. Where a linked delete
removes a fitted row, the existing ``remap_matched_peak_lists`` handling
runs exactly as it does for a plain fitted delete — no new matched
semantics anywhere.
