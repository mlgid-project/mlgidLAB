"""Linux desktop integration: the ``.desktop`` entry and themed icons.

``QApplication.setWindowIcon`` is enough for the window's own titlebar,
and on X11 it also fills ``_NET_WM_ICON``. It is *not* enough for the
shell's app surfaces -- the dash, the window switcher, the top bar. GNOME
resolves a window to an **application** first and takes the icon from
that application's ``.desktop`` file; the window's own icon is only the
fallback for a window it could not match, and on Wayland there is no
fallback at all, because ``app_id`` is the only thing the compositor
gets.

mlgidLAB shipped no ``.desktop`` file, so there was nothing to match.
Windows already had its counterpart of this problem solved (the explicit
AppUserModelID in ``mlgidlab.main``, without which the taskbar groups the
app under ``python.exe``); this is the Linux half.

Two pieces have to agree for the match to happen:

* ``QGuiApplication.setDesktopFileName(DESKTOP_NAME)`` -- Qt advertises
  this as the Wayland ``app_id`` and as the X11 ``WM_CLASS`` instance
  name. Called from ``mlgidlab.main`` before the first window exists,
  because both are set at window-creation time and are not re-read.
* A ``DESKTOP_NAME.desktop`` file on the XDG search path, whose ``Icon=``
  names an icon installed in the hicolor theme.

``StartupWMClass`` is written too. It is redundant while the two names
above agree, and it is what keeps the match working if they ever stop
agreeing (a renamed entry point, say).

Everything here is best-effort: a read-only or unusual ``$HOME`` should
cost the dash icon, never the startup. The caller logs and moves on.
